      <p>Hey...just wanted to say you're really cool and I loved hanging out with you. To be honest, I was having a pretty bad day before tonight. I’m feeling better now.</p>

      <p>Was hoping we could hang again sometime? I don't know the next time I'll be in the area, but...hope to see you around soon.</p>

          <p>Hey again. It’s me. It's been awhile, huh? Sorry about that. I've been really busy with, you know, life and stuff. I'm happy you waited all this time, though. You've changed a little bit but I don't mind; in fact, the thing that makes you really fun to be around is still there. And I really really appreciate that.</p>

          <p>I’m really glad I came. To be honest--god, this is so embarrassing--I was terrified to come today. Lately I feel like I’ve been missing something under the weight of all of this blah stuff. I don’t even like school. It’s just a constant race to not fail at grades or social life or whatever. Something in my mind wanted to escape. Something in my mind longed for the feeling of letting go. Like that day when I first met you.</p>

          <p>“I don’t want to be a zombie,” I thought. “I don’t want to lose sleep over classes I don’t care about or procrastinate on papers or pretend to be cool in front of other people any more”. Of course, I would never admit it out loud. It looks really bad to admit that you can’t handle the pressure. But the more I wanted to leave my life, the more I could hear my heart thumping to a different rhythm--a rhythm from long ago. The more the idea marinated, the more tangible it felt.</p>

          <p>So one day I thought screw it. I’ll come over. </p>

          <p>And the moment I got off the Canal Street station, I tripped--because of a missing step that I never noticed, because of the sudden baggage weighing down my shoulders. The idea of coming to Chinatown on my own, no matter how sunny it sounded, was only that: a laughable wisp of an idea, floating around in my head, ready to disappear at any moment.</p>
